# Bookworm [https://bookworm-bookshelf.netlify.app/](https://bookworm-bookshelf.netlify.app/)

Book Worm is a React-based web application that allows users to search for books and add them to their virtual bookshelf. The application uses local storage to persist the user's bookshelf data.

## Features

- **Search Books**: Users can search for books by title or author.
- **Add to Bookshelf**: Users can add books to their personal bookshelf.
- **Remove from Bookshelf**: Users can remove books from their personal bookshelf.
- **Persistent Data**: Bookshelf data is stored in local storage, so it persists across page reloads.

## Installation

To get started with the Book Worm project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

## Running the Application
